# AES
The project was developed for university course _Parallel and distributed programming_ completion.
The purpose of this project was to implement Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm using four different approaches / 
techniques: 
* Sequential version
* OpenMP
* MPI
* GPU 

## Building & Running
Each sub-project has dedicated `info.txt` file which contains description of building and running algorithm. 

## Used technologies
Algorithm was implemented using Java 8. Additionally, following technologies were used:
* OpenMP - https://github.com/omp4j/omp4j
* MPI - https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=java
* GPU - http://www.jcuda.org/
